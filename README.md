# ANLY506
This repository contains essential folders for ANLY506 course project, like Data, Code, Figures and Portfolio.

## Primary Goal
The primary focus of this project is to perform EDA on gapminder dataset and find out all the insights from the data.

## Data Description
Dataset Name: gapminder

Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birdsarah/pydata-nc/master/tutorial/assets/gapminder.csv

Fields: Country,Year,life,population,income,region

Number of Rows and Columns: 41284 rows and 6 columns

## Insights
Performed extensive exploratory data analysis by utilizing data importing, transforming or clensing and plotting techiques.

In the year 1800, "Europe & Central Asia" region had highest income than compared to any other regions. And the same region had more life tenure as well when compared with other regions. In Europe & Central Asia" region, Netherlands had more income than compared to any other country in that region. And Iceland country had more life tenure when compared to other countries in the region. Hwoever, when i find out the life tenure of Iceland country across all years, found out interesting metrics which are: during period 1800-1900, there are indistinct spikes, meaning life tenure drastically reduced and increased in-between, during 1901-1950 there was slight decrease and increaseand during 1950 to 2015, there was constant raise in life tenure of Iceland country population, which means they had a longer life tenure. Interesting insights found out when i tried to further analyze life tenure of all regions, "South Asia" and "Sub-Saharan Africa" regions had outliers and "MIddle East & North Africa" region had very less population and high income but life tenure wasn't matching with expectation. Digged through data to further undertand why it happened and found out that due to certain countries like "Tunisia", "Western Sahara", "Djibouti" and "Algeria" had life tenure less than 20 years.
